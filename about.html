                    Fitbyte is a capstone project from NAU's 2018-19 school year.
                    FitByte is a project that is working on a solution to aid Dr. 
                    Kyle Winfree and Dr. Gregory Dominick in their Fitbit research 
                    to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle. Our goals are to grant 
                    them secure access WearWare databases via an API, help them process 
                    the data retrieved from their Fitbit users, and eventually be able 
                    to monitor participant data and send motivating SMS messages.

                Project Description:
            </h1>

                <h1 class="subtitle is-4">
                    Dr. Kyle Winfree and Dr. Gregory Dominick gave participants Fitbits to use
                    so they could monitor and track the data collected from these devices. 
                    While studying the data, they realized that some of the data collected 
                    are very inaccurate, but can be fixed. Kyle and Gregory work with BE-SMART 
                    in Delaware and are looking for a secure and reliable way to share the data 
                    that they have acquired through their research. They are looking for us to 
                    create a “bridge” that allows them to securely fetch data from the server located
                    on an AWS server that will eventually be processed to remove the irregularities 
                    that Fitbit provides. They also want the data to be analyzed in real time in order to 
                    monitor participant fitness behaviors in order to have motivating SMS text messages sent 
                    if the analysis shows a period of poor activity. Our team, Fitbyte, hopes to 
                    solve their problems by providing secure access to the data stored in databases 
                    and create an API that processes and analyzes the data. This will save them lots of 
                    valuable time and help accelerate their research.
