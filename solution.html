                    Our team will be gutting the existing WearWare 1.0 project and 
                    rewriting the entire UI as well as making any improvements to the
                    backend and database as we see fit. One of these backend improvements 
                    that we will be making is implementing an API for authenticated users 
                    to request data for specific users within a date range.
                    This will lead us to a product that will work much better for our sponsors.
                    <br></br>
                    The UI improvements will help Dr. Winfree complete his research more 
                    easily and with less headaches. The backend improvements will also
                    help him as there are currently some pages that take a long time to 
                    export data.
                    <br></br>
                    The addition of an API will help Dr. Dominick receive data much more 
                    quicly and efficiently. Currently the process of getting the data is 
                    very inefficient and requires a lot of manual work. With the addition 
                    of an API, Dr. Dominick will be able to collect data rapidly and 
                    autonomously with the help of scripts written by his team in Delaware.
